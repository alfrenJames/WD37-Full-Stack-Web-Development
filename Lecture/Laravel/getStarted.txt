// create laravel 
//After you have installed PHP and Composer, you may create a new Laravel project via the Composer create-project command:

composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app

//Or, you may create new Laravel projects by globally installing the Laravel installer via Composer:

composer global require laravel/installer
 
laravel new example-app

//After the project has been created, start Laravel's local development server using the Laravel's Artisan CLI serve command:

cd example-app
 
php artisan serve

//The easiest way to keep using Bootstrap in Laravel 10 is by creating a new Laravel project and then using the two commands :

composer require laravel/ui --dev
php artisan ui bootstrap --auth

//Create bootstrap module + authentication 
composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app
// Laravel ui - that will allow to add bootstrap
composer require laravel/ui --dev
//bootstarp scaffolding this install latest bootstrap 
php artisan ui bootstrap --auth
//add bootstrap dependencies like icons 
npm install bootstrap icons --save-dev
//create database 
php artisan migrate
// finalize the changes 
npm install 
npm run dev

//create model 
// -m will create database migration
php artisan make:model <modelName> -m 

//to excute your migration 
php artisan migrate
//seed the database
php artisan seed
